# Commit Info Rule

When the user says **"اطلاعات کامیت"** (or equivalent like "commit info", "commit message"):

1. **Output** in plain text, easy to copy
2. **Title**: Short, in English, simple words (e.g. `feat: add X`)
3. **Description**: Bullet list of changes, in English, simple words
4. **Scope**: Include all changes since the last time they asked for commit info, or since the start of the conversation
5. **Format**:

```
## Summary
<one-line title>

## Description
<bullet list of changes>
```

6. Base the content on: edited files, added/deleted files, and discussed/implemented features in this session
